You open the cargo hold and switch to your external cameras, where you see thousands of people waiting in line as doctors distribute the medications to them. Just as the doctors take out the last batch of the cargo out of your hold, you notice a message pop up on your interface, "Meet me on Earth, <last>. It's urgent."
